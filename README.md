# Creeper... Oh man!!

## So we back in the mine
## Got the pickaxe swinging from side to side
## Side side to side

## This tasks a drooling one
## Hope to find some diamonds tonight night night
## Diamonds tonight

## Heads up
## You hear a sound, turn around and woke up
## Total Shock fills your body

## Oh no it's you again
## I can never forget those eyes eyes eyes
### Guess the rest... :)
